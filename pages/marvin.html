        <h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
        <p>It was a school project where we had fewer than two weeks to come up with an interactive longread. This article was for the Belgian radio station Nostalgie and we could choose from a list of notorious people who had led quite interesting lives. After doing some research, we chose Marvin Gaye because there was a lot of information available, as well as plenty of images to choose from. Besides that we liked the artist and found his life interesting to discuss.</p>
        <p>I was mainly responsible for the concept, UI, UX, research, content and front end of the website. Baptist Standaert who was my group partner, focused more on visual design, motion graphics and supported with the CSS.</p>

            <li>Do the full research, concept, design and development in 12 days</li>
            <li>Present the content in such a way that you can easily read it but still have an immersive experience</li>
            <li>Google pagespeed of at least 90% is required and it should be responsive</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How can we find the right angle to present the story so people will read a 1500 words long article?</li>
            <li>How can we create an interactive story throughout the website, where our content is visualised in more ways than just plain text?</li>
            <li>How can we find the right visual style to fit the story and its theme?</li>
            <li>How to find the right balance between what we want to create and what we can create in less than two weeks?</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="work work-approach">
        <img src="../assets/marvin_2.jpg" alt="example of the storyboarding for the marvin gaye website" class="case-img"></img>
        <h2 class="section-title">Approach</h2>
        <p>Do your research, know your subject. TLDR: Did two days of research about the life of Marvin Gaye. Made storyboards instead of regular wireframes. Wrote our own content even though it wasn’t necessary.</p>
        <p>Get inspired. TLDR: If you only have 12 days, don’t try to spend all of your time coming up with new and creative ways to present your content. We were heavily influenced by <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/" target="_blank">Pitchfork’s cover stories</a>.</p>
        <p>Create an experience. TLDR: We mixed motion graphics with interesting content divided into readable chunks to keep the user’s attention. Besides that we tried to link the visual design to the story by using bright colours, black and white photography and hand drawn illustrations matching the content.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Result and retrospective</h2>
        <p>The delivered project is still online. I have written about this project in the past, so this has been interesting to rewrite and re-evaluate this case. Looking back at it, I’m still proud of what we accomplished in such a short period of time. This is one of my favourite projects in terms of great collaboration and time management. However, there are some things I would change:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have a more visually balanced design. Sometimes the text is too long, sometimes the colours are too bright or the motion graphics effects are too laggy. This could really interrupt the experience.</li>
            <li>Have an even better mobile experience. To be honest we focused mainly on desktop for this project, so the results on mobile just don’t have the same effect. That said, we could also test if people really want to read such a long story on their phone and want to load such an experience on 4G for example.</li>
            <li>I am not a robot. I’ve come to realise working for at least ten hours a day for twelve days straight whilst having almost no social interaction or physical activity is not healthy.</li>
        </ul>
