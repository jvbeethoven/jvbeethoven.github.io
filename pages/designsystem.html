        <h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
        <p>At one of the companies I worked for, we decided to create a design system. Big buzzword alert here, but there was an actual underlying reason why we decided to build a small scale system. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>There was a lot of chaos in the applications that we worked on;</li>
            <li>We were building multiple big platforms, of which the design was inconsistent;</li>
            <li>The design being implemented had no proper guidance and resulted in bad user experience</li>
            <li>The UI/component library needed a big update;</li>
            <li>There was no real design knowledge in the company so it would be a good opportunity to educate everyone on making good design choices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One other designer and I were given some time spend on creating a system that would tackle the issues mentioned above. Below you can read more about our proces.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Result and retrospective</h2>
        <p>Working on a design system has been quite challenging and interesting for me personally. However, there have been a lot of things that I learned through failure whilst working on this project.</p>
        <p>First of all, this was my real first job after having graduated. There wasn't any established design process in the company and I felt that I needed a design mentor. After struggling for a bit more than one year, I've eventually decided to leave the company as I wanted to learn from others first before tackling such an impactful project.</p>
